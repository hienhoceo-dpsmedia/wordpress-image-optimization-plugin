== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/improve-image-delivery-pagespeed/` directory, or install through WordPress admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Navigate to 'Improve Image Delivery PageSpeed' in your admin menu
4. Configure your optimization settings
5. Click 'Start Complete Optimization' to begin converting your images

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What image formats are supported? =

The plugin converts JPEG and PNG images to WebP format. AVIF support is planned for future releases.

= Can I remove all WebP files if I don't want them anymore? =

Yes! The plugin includes a "Remove All WebP Files" button that will safely delete all WebP files created by the plugin while preserving your original images.

= What's the difference between this and automatic optimization plugins? =

Automatic plugins process images in the background, which can cause server load spikes and unexpected processing. This plugin gives you manual control - you decide when to optimize, preventing server overload and giving you transparency over the process.

= Do I need LiteSpeed Cache? =

No, but it's recommended for optimal performance. The plugin includes fallback options:

* **URL Replacement**: Automatically replaces image URLs in HTML with WebP versions
* **.htaccess Rules**: Automatically generates and manages server rules for WebP serving
* **Browser Detection**: Serves WebP to modern browsers, originals to older ones

These fallback options work without LiteSpeed Cache, but LiteSpeed Cache provides better performance and caching.

= How do the .htaccess rules work? =

The plugin can automatically add rules to your .htaccess file that:

* Detect if the browser supports WebP format
* Check if a WebP version exists for the requested image
* Automatically serve the WebP version to compatible browsers
* Fall back to original images for older browsers

You can preview, add, or remove these rules from the plugin dashboard.

= Will this break my website? =

No. Original images are preserved, and the plugin serves WebP versions only when browsers support them. Older browsers automatically receive the original images.

= How much space can I save? =

WebP images are typically 25-35% smaller than JPEG equivalents with the same visual quality. Results may vary depending on your images.

= Can I convert images in bulk? =

Yes. You can use the bulk actions in the Media Library or the batch conversion tools in the plugin dashboard.

= What happens to my original images? =

Original images are preserved. The plugin creates WebP versions alongside your originals, ensuring complete compatibility.

= Does this work with CDNs? =

The plugin works best with LiteSpeed Cache and LiteSpeed's CDN. For other CDNs, you may need additional configuration.
